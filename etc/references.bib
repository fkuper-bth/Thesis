	abstract = {Mobile application development is currently seen as one of the most indispensable skills due to the recent boom in the population using smartphones and tablets. Due to the abundance and diversity of devices and platforms, developing applications for mobile devices is a complicated task involving multiple alternatives, technologies, and trade-offs. The development of applications in a cross-platform framework has become more prevalent in recent years. However, it is less clear which of the three major frame-works for android development, React Native, Flutter, and Kotlin is the most efficient in general comparisons.In this work, we have analyzed empirically the performance of three mobile application frameworks: Flutter, React-Native and Kotlin. Three tic-tac-toe games are designed using Flutter, React-Native and Kotlin, and their performance is compared on the basis of various parameters such as {CPU} usage, Memory usage, packages and their installations to understand the advantages and disadvantages of cross-platform and native mobile development. Our work also aims to assist developers in determining which framework is most suited to their requirements by comparing them in areas such as environment, development languages and ease of use. The results have indicated that Kotlin has a slight advantage over the two cross-platform technologies, Flutter and React Native. Memory usage of React-Native and Flutter were approximately 13.3\% and 1.6\% more than Kotlin respectively. Similarly, the application sizes of React-Native and Flutter are 98.06MB and 93.32 {MB} respectively, with Kotlin coming in last at 11.06 {MB}. In future, further investigation of the topics covered in this work is required to ensure and enhance the findings.},

	title = {Empowering Female Founders with {AI} and Play: Integration of a Large Language Model into a Serious Game with Player-Generated Content},
	isbn = {978-3-031-60695-3},
	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to empower female founders by integrating a Large Language Model ({LLM}) into a serious game featuring player-generated content. The game leverages interactive visual novels to enhance resilience and awareness of gender-based discrimination in startup environments. The implementation of generative {AI} for bias detection in the conversations encountered by founders enables the provision of insightful feedback on discriminatory elements within the visual novels in which players immerse themselves. The game allows players to create personalized visual novels, reflecting their own entrepreneurial experiences. The system selects backgrounds, characters, and dialogue options, transforming players into creators while identifying and providing feedback on discriminatory elements within stories. The game's architecture, designed for modularity, supports the integration of various {LLMs}, enhancing its adaptability and future-proofing. Preliminary results demonstrate the game's feasibility, with expert evaluations affirming the effectiveness of its bias and discrimination detection mechanisms. This research contributes to the fields of gender equality and entrepreneurship in the digital domain, highlighting the potential of serious games and {AI} in addressing social challenges.},
