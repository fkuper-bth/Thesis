	abstract = {Mobile application development is currently seen as one of the most indispensable skills due to the recent boom in the population using smartphones and tablets. Due to the abundance and diversity of devices and platforms, developing applications for mobile devices is a complicated task involving multiple alternatives, technologies, and trade-offs. The development of applications in a cross-platform framework has become more prevalent in recent years. However, it is less clear which of the three major frame-works for android development, React Native, Flutter, and Kotlin is the most efficient in general comparisons.In this work, we have analyzed empirically the performance of three mobile application frameworks: Flutter, React-Native and Kotlin. Three tic-tac-toe games are designed using Flutter, React-Native and Kotlin, and their performance is compared on the basis of various parameters such as {CPU} usage, Memory usage, packages and their installations to understand the advantages and disadvantages of cross-platform and native mobile development. Our work also aims to assist developers in determining which framework is most suited to their requirements by comparing them in areas such as environment, development languages and ease of use. The results have indicated that Kotlin has a slight advantage over the two cross-platform technologies, Flutter and React Native. Memory usage of React-Native and Flutter were approximately 13.3\% and 1.6\% more than Kotlin respectively. Similarly, the application sizes of React-Native and Flutter are 98.06MB and 93.32 {MB} respectively, with Kotlin coming in last at 11.06 {MB}. In future, further investigation of the topics covered in this work is required to ensure and enhance the findings.},

	isbn = {978-3-031-60695-3},
	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to empower female founders by integrating a Large Language Model ({LLM}) into a serious game featuring player-generated content. The game leverages interactive visual novels to enhance resilience and awareness of gender-based discrimination in startup environments. The implementation of generative {AI} for bias detection in the conversations encountered by founders enables the provision of insightful feedback on discriminatory elements within the visual novels in which players immerse themselves. The game allows players to create personalized visual novels, reflecting their own entrepreneurial experiences. The system selects backgrounds, characters, and dialogue options, transforming players into creators while identifying and providing feedback on discriminatory elements within stories. The game's architecture, designed for modularity, supports the integration of various {LLMs}, enhancing its adaptability and future-proofing. Preliminary results demonstrate the game's feasibility, with expert evaluations affirming the effectiveness of its bias and discrimination detection mechanisms. This research contributes to the fields of gender equality and entrepreneurship in the digital domain, highlighting the potential of serious games and {AI} in addressing social challenges.},

	abstract = {The most important deliverable of the requirements engineering process is the software requirements specification({SRS})document. Requirements documentation is important during the complete software development lifecycle to share the vision and effective communication between major stakeholders. The Standish Group reported that the top factors behind project failures are related to requirements. By giving the right level of attention to key requirements good quality software can be produced. Therefore, more research is needed in this area and this study is trying to fill this gap. This empirical study aims to examine the importance of pair documentation. Unconventional documentation refers to the approach when two persons work on the same document's requirements collaboratively just like pair programming on the requirements quality and team productivity. Twenty pairs of documentation writers worked into two groups. one group using pair documentation, i.e., the experimental group, and the other one using conventional documentation, i.e., the control group. the resultant requirement's documents for the same project, produced by both groups were then compared. It is observed that there is a significant improvement in the quality and productivity of the experimental group using pair documentation. The findings of this study may assist requirement engineers in forming efficient teams that can create high-quality {SRS} documents.},

	abstract = {Many domain-specific languages, that try to bring feasible alternatives for existing solutions while simplifying programming work, have come up in recent years. Although, these little languages seem to be easy to use, there is an open issue whether they bring advantages in comparison to the application libraries, which are the most commonly used implementation approach. In this work, we present an experiment, which was carried out to compare such a domain-specific language with a comparable application library. The experiment was conducted with 36 programmers, who have answered a questionnaire on both implementation approaches. The questionnaire is more than 100 pages long. For a domain-specific language and the application library, the same problem domain has been used - construction of graphical user interfaces. In terms of a domain-specific language, {XAML} has been used and C\# Forms for the application library. A cognitive dimension framework has been used for a comparison between {XAML} and C\# Forms.},
