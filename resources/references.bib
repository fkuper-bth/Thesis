	abstract = {Mobile application development is currently seen as one of the most indispensable skills due to the recent boom in the population using smartphones and tablets. Due to the abundance and diversity of devices and platforms, developing applications for mobile devices is a complicated task involving multiple alternatives, technologies, and trade-offs. The development of applications in a cross-platform framework has become more prevalent in recent years. However, it is less clear which of the three major frame-works for android development, React Native, Flutter, and Kotlin is the most efficient in general comparisons.In this work, we have analyzed empirically the performance of three mobile application frameworks: Flutter, React-Native and Kotlin. Three tic-tac-toe games are designed using Flutter, React-Native and Kotlin, and their performance is compared on the basis of various parameters such as {CPU} usage, Memory usage, packages and their installations to understand the advantages and disadvantages of cross-platform and native mobile development. Our work also aims to assist developers in determining which framework is most suited to their requirements by comparing them in areas such as environment, development languages and ease of use. The results have indicated that Kotlin has a slight advantage over the two cross-platform technologies, Flutter and React Native. Memory usage of React-Native and Flutter were approximately 13.3\% and 1.6\% more than Kotlin respectively. Similarly, the application sizes of React-Native and Flutter are 98.06MB and 93.32 {MB} respectively, with Kotlin coming in last at 11.06 {MB}. In future, further investigation of the topics covered in this work is required to ensure and enhance the findings.},

	isbn = {978-3-031-60695-3},
	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to empower female founders by integrating a Large Language Model ({LLM}) into a serious game featuring player-generated content. The game leverages interactive visual novels to enhance resilience and awareness of gender-based discrimination in startup environments. The implementation of generative {AI} for bias detection in the conversations encountered by founders enables the provision of insightful feedback on discriminatory elements within the visual novels in which players immerse themselves. The game allows players to create personalized visual novels, reflecting their own entrepreneurial experiences. The system selects backgrounds, characters, and dialogue options, transforming players into creators while identifying and providing feedback on discriminatory elements within stories. The game's architecture, designed for modularity, supports the integration of various {LLMs}, enhancing its adaptability and future-proofing. Preliminary results demonstrate the game's feasibility, with expert evaluations affirming the effectiveness of its bias and discrimination detection mechanisms. This research contributes to the fields of gender equality and entrepreneurship in the digital domain, highlighting the potential of serious games and {AI} in addressing social challenges.},

	abstract = {The most important deliverable of the requirements engineering process is the software requirements specification({SRS})document. Requirements documentation is important during the complete software development lifecycle to share the vision and effective communication between major stakeholders. The Standish Group reported that the top factors behind project failures are related to requirements. By giving the right level of attention to key requirements good quality software can be produced. Therefore, more research is needed in this area and this study is trying to fill this gap. This empirical study aims to examine the importance of pair documentation. Unconventional documentation refers to the approach when two persons work on the same document's requirements collaboratively just like pair programming on the requirements quality and team productivity. Twenty pairs of documentation writers worked into two groups. one group using pair documentation, i.e., the experimental group, and the other one using conventional documentation, i.e., the control group. the resultant requirement's documents for the same project, produced by both groups were then compared. It is observed that there is a significant improvement in the quality and productivity of the experimental group using pair documentation. The findings of this study may assist requirement engineers in forming efficient teams that can create high-quality {SRS} documents.},

Although, these little languages seem to be easy to use, there is an open issue whether they bring advantages in comparison to the application libraries, which are the most commonly used implementation approach. In this work, we present an experiment, which was carried out to compare such a domain-specific language with a comparable application library. The experiment was conducted with 36 programmers, who have answered a questionnaire on both implementation approaches. The questionnaire is more than 100 pages long. For a domain-specific language and the application library, the same problem domain has been used - construction of graphical user interfaces. In terms of a domain-specific language, {XAML} has been used and C\# Forms for the application library. A cognitive dimension framework has been used for a comparison between {XAML} and C\# Forms.},

	abstract = {Background
The {COVID}-19-related pandemic has affected education hugely, particularly in terms of the massive shift towards online teaching and learning. Higher education students and professors have faced new challenges, which might improve future online education behaviour, based on online education experience and learning, and pedagogical strategies during the {COVID}-19 pandemic.
Objective/Aim
The aim of this paper is to explore the views of Romanian students towards a possible future online education, highlighting their perceptions regarding the efficacy of digital online learning/pedagogical strategies and of the technological infrastructure, using as support theory the Input-Environment-Outcomes (I-E-O) model.
Methods/Instruments
An empirical quantitative-based investigation was implemented; data being collected from almost 800 students in business and economics. Based on the proposed conceptual model, data were analysed with structural equations modelling via {SmartPLS} 3.0.
Results
The novelty of the paper is that it tries to address students’ perceptions regarding the future of online education, by using a few constructs, some of them validated in the literature, in order to establish pertinent links between these and the future of digital education. Results reveal that Romanian students prefer face-to-face teaching rather than online courses.
Conclusions/implications
In crisis situations, digital education might be the proper solution for future education, as it ensures effective education through efficient teaching-learning strategies and an advanced technological infrastructure.},

	abstract = {A serious game is a type of game that is designed for a primary purpose other than entertainment. Instead, serious games are intended to achieve specific goals, such as education, training, or health promotion. The goal of serious games is to engage players in a way that is both enjoyable and effective in achieving the intended learning or behavior change outcomes. Recently, several systematic reviews on the development and application of serious games and on the application of gamification techniques have been published, which indicate high activity and ongoing progress in this area of research. Such an extensive body of review papers raises the need to analyze and extract the current state and the prevailing trends of the serious games and gamification ({SGG}) domain by analyzing and summarizing the systematic review articles. This study presents a systematic meta-review, i.e., a review of the 53 survey papers on the domain of serious games and gamification. The systematic review follows the {PRISMA} guidelines, while constructive and cross-sectional methods are used to analyze and present the results. Finally, this study identifies the future trends and challenges for the domain. As a result, the meta-review helps the reader to quickly assess the present status of {SGG} and serves as a reference for finding further information on each technology utilized in {SGG}. Using the criterion of the citations, the meta-review analysis provides insight into the quantity and academic relevance of the published {SGG} articles. Moreover, 53 articles published in journals were selected as important surveys in the research field. The study found that serious games and gamification techniques are increasingly being used for a wide range of health conditions and the focus is shifting towards the use of mobile and digital platforms, virtual reality, and machine learning to personalize and adapt interventions. The existing research gaps include the lack of standardization in development and evaluation, insufficient understanding of underlying mechanisms of action, limited understanding of integration into existing healthcare systems, limited understanding of specific game mechanics and design elements for promoting health behaviors, and limited research on scalability, adoption, and long-term effects. These research gaps highlight the need for further research to fully understand the potential and limitations of serious games and gamification for health and how to effectively apply them.},

The aim is to set design principles for educators attempting to create visual novel games for their teaching purposes, by exploring the research question ‘What is the educational potential of visual novel game narratives, and how can this be translated into game design principles for educators?’ We explored the possibility of creating learning opportunities inside games by utilizing learning design theory and learning theory principles, as well as concepts related to learning, identity and narratives. Next, we conducted close readings of popular Japanese visual novel games localized for English-speaking audiences, and used examples from these games to elaborate on the principles. By combining the findings from both steps, we have proposed the following design principles: (1) Easy access to educational subject matter, (2) Exemplification of topics and ‘defamiliarization’ of the familiar, (3) Creation of well-developed characters that promote identification, (4) Use of branching narratives that are interesting for learners, (5) Use of a structured and creative design for learning, (6) Clear goals and strategies for assessment.},
